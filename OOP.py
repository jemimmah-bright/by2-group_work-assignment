# # 1.	Basic: Create a class called Car with attributes brand and color. Instantiate an object
# #  of the Car class and print its attributes.
# class car: 
#     def __init__(my_car,brand,color):
#         my_car.brand = brand
#         my_car.color = color
# car2 = car("Vanguard","White")
# print(car2.brand)
# print(car2.color)
# # 2.	Intermediate: Add a method called start_engine to the Car class that prints a 
# # message saying the engine of the car has started. Create an instance of Car and call the method.

# class car: 
#     def __init__(my_car,brand,color):
#         my_car.brand = brand
#         my_car.color = color
#     def start_engine(unbeilievable):
#         print(f"The engine of the car has started")
# car2 = car("Vanguard","White")
# car2.start_engine()


# 3.	Advanced: Create a class called BankAccount with attributes account_number and balance. Add methods to:
# ○	Deposit an amount.
# ○	Withdraw an amount (only if sufficient balance exists).
# ○	Print the account balance.
class bank_account:
    def __init__(account1,account_number = "12345678ug",balannce = 100000000):
        account1.account_number = account_number
        account1.balance = balannce
    def deposit(account1,amount):
        if amount>0:
            account1.balance += amount
            print(f"{amount}. new balance: {account1.balance}")
        else:
            print(f"deposite amount must be positive not negative") 
    def withdraw (account1,amount):
        if amount >0:
            if amount <= account1.balance:
                account1.balance -= amount
                print(f"withdraw {amount}. new balance: {account1.balance}")
            else:
                print("insufficient balance and withdraw amount must be positive")
    def print_balance(account1):
        print(f"Account number: {account1.account_number}")
        print(f"Current balance: {account1.balance}")


# 4.	Challenge: Implement a class called Library that manages a collection of books.
#  Each book has a title, author, and available status. The Library class should have methods to:
# ○	Add a book to the library.
# ○	Remove a book from the library.
# ○	Check if a book is available by title.
# ○	Borrow a book (mark it as unavailable if it’s available).
# ○	Return a book (mark it as available again if it was borrowed).

# class library :
#     def __init__(book,title,author,available_status):
