# # 1.	Basic: Create a dictionary with three key-value pairs representing a 
# # student's information: name, age, and grade. Print each key-value pair on a new line.
# # Creating the dictionary
# student_info = {
#     "name": "Jemimmah",  
#     "age": "20",
#     "grade": "A"
# }
# for key, value in student_info.items():
#     print(f"{key}: {value} \n")

    
# # 2.	Intermediate: Write a function that takes a dictionary of people's
# #  names and their ages, {'Alice': 24, 'Bob': 19, 'Charlie': 30}, and 
# # returns a list of names of people who are 21 or older.
# def get_adults(peoples_dictionary):
#     adults = []
#     for name, age in peoples_dictionary.items():
#         if age >= 21:
#             adults.append(name)
#     return adults
# people= {'Alice': 24, 'Bob': 19, 'Charlie': 30}
# result = get_adults(people)
# print(result)  


# # 3.	Advanced: Given a dictionary representing items in a store with their prices, 
# # {'apple': 0.5, 'banana': 0.3, 'orange': 0.7}, write a program that takes a list of items 
# # bought, ['apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'banana'], and calculates the total cost.
 
# def store_items_with_prices():
#     dictionary = {'apple': 0.5, 'banana': 0.3, 'orange': 0.7}
#     items_bought = ["apple","oranges","banana"]
#     total_cost = sum(dictionary[items_bought] for item in items_bought)
#     print (f"The total cost of the item bought is:${total_cost}")
# store_items_with_prices() 



# 4.	Challenge: Write a program that counts the occurrences of each word in a given sentence. 
# Example: for the sentence "hello world hello," the output should be {'hello': 2, 'world': 1}.

sentence = "hello hello world"
words = sentence.split()
word_count = {}
for word in words:
    word_count[word] = word_count.get(word,0) + 1
    print("Word occurances:")
for word, count in word_count.items():
    print(f"{word}:{count}")
